    "## Mixed Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "One important consideration in using GLM's is that the model assumes the data is independent. In our auto bodily injury dataset, we are assuming the no claimant is represented in more than one claim. If a claimant had filed two different claims, then we should ask ourselves, \"How might the first claim have impacted the likelihood of experiencing the second? How independent are these events?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible explanations for why these events may not be independent could include:\n",
    "- first accident left claimant with impaired driving abilities (physical and/or mental)\n",
    "- claimant is continuing poor driving habits that resulted in first accident\n",
    "- claimant is committing multiple cases of insurance fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "This is somewhat of a simplification, but it demonstrates the importance of understanding why models should try to capture nonindependence where it may be present. Mixed effects models handle this by accounting for random effects (or variance components) in addition to fixed effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the GLMM package currently only supports Poisson and binomial distributions for the target variable, let's use a different dataset that includes claim count for simulated auto collisions over three years. We'll filter down to one year and claim count as our target variable."
